Some documents outlining the development of a model for attitude control of a satellite. Document 1 is focused on Quaternions and Reaction Wheels. Document 2 replaces Quaternions with DCMs, which are then replaced with small-angle approximated roll/pitch/yaw. Document 3 will focus on thrusters once I finish transcribing it from my notes.
