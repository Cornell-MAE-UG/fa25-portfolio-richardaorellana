## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Richard Orellana and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. I have always been interested in mathematics and science ever since I was young and that led me to pursue engineering. This is only the start of my portfolio as necessitated by the MAE department and I hope to include something interesting soon!!!
